<h2><i><u>Assessment 1: My Profile</i></u></h2>
<center><h3><b><u>Personal Information</b></u></h3></center>


<p><b>Name:</b>Patrick Peter Schroeder</p>

<p><b>Student Number:</b>s3955559</p>

<p><b>Nationality & Culture:</b> Well truth be told I am a bit of a mixed bag. My father is 100% German, therefore that makes me 50% German and the rest can be split up between, Greek, English and Afrikaans, which is my mothers’ side of the family. As I grew up in South Africa we mainly followed their culture, being meat lovers and loved a good old braai (BBQ). This changed once a year when we visited my German gran for a month while on holiday, which then included Pork Knuckle, Bratwurst (Grilled Sausage), Spätzle (Egg Noodles) and Sauerkraut (Fermented Cabbage). </p>

<p><b>Education:</b>Completed grade 12. Got a certificate in Basics of Business and Management and also have a National certificate N4.</p>

<p><b>Languages Spoken:</b>English, Afrikaans and partly German</p>

<p><b>Fun Fact:</b>I currently play roller hockey for the Mighty Ducks, which is exactly like Ice Hockey, but using Inline Skates</p>

<center><h3><b><u>Interest in IT</b></u></h3></center>

<p>My IT interest first started back in 1987 when I got my first Atari 1200XL, how exciting the door to the world of computers had just opened to me. I can still remember the book that came with it, silver cover and written on the front in big black letters, the words BASIC. This was the first programming language I was introduced to. Spent hours writing code, only to land up drawing a single triangle. At this stage I thought watch out Bill Gates, thinking I would change the world. Then it seemed to phased out for a while, more interested in dating that computers, until I joined the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, where I was introduced to COBOL. Self-taught, I wrote many data queries but never really did and programming, and through time lost interest. I’m back, just like Arnold Schwarzenegger, working towards a Computer Science Degree, hopefully majoring in Data Analytics.    
My main reason for joining RMIT is that it offered me flexibility, allowing me to study online. Having a full-time job certainly meant that I could not attend classes, therefore changed my enrolment from UTAS to RMIT, which I am glad I did. Lucky for me I approached Open University Australia who helped me with a seamless enrolment process and here I am. 
My expectations are really to start at the very beginning and close the loop of what I already know, or believe I know about IT. It boggles the mind to think it all comes down ones and zeros, and what does that really mean. Its early days I’ll admit so one thing at a time at this stage.

<p>What I find really appealing about this job is that it combines my two interests, Data Analytics and Financial Markets. What this job requires is continued improvement, through the implementation of various projects to enhance and the support of internal business processes and critical systems. Using your ability to problem solve and collaborate with various business units for best practice and better outcomes.</p>
<p>You will require 3 years minimum of relevant Xplan experience. Xplan is an analytical tool used by Financial Planners. The need to be a problem solver with great communication skills and analytical thinking using your in-depth knowledge of IT to be able to do data extraction using relevant software.

I have reached out to one of the departments in the current organisation I work for and have indicated my interest and availability, as they will be embarking on a big data project fairly soon. This lends itself to then getting some valuable experience while I am studying as well, setting me up for success for a future position.</p>

<p>These results are a good determination of characteristic that define who I am and how I act and interact with others. They allow me the opportunity to focus on my strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>These results will allow the ability to determine how I need to interact within a team. Behaviour is a critical part of any team dynamic as it is imperative that you work and collaborate as one unit for the great good of the project and members of the team.  This will also allow me to manage my style of communication and participation for the best outcome within the team.</p> 
<p>People who have similar interests and thought patterns generally tend to work better together, however you need diversity within a team to be able to cover all aspects within a project for the best outcome. As I am only in control of my own behaviours I need to remain mindful of areas of concern that I need to work on so I don’t allow them to change or influence the outcome of other within the team. We all work together to achieve more.</p>

<center><h3><b><u>Project Idea</b></u></h3></center>

<p>My project idea that I have settled on is hologram imagery, although ambitious at this early stage of my IT journey I thought it important to challenge myself. The main idea is to be able to create a three-dimensional meeting room where participants can join the meeting and interact with each other. This have become even more important due to the current isolation experienced due to Covid. As human beings we require social interaction and this will I believe make this possible. This also opens the door to reduce costs due to traveling and increase efficiencies within an organisation. This will have positive effects on both work life balance and global warm.</p>
<p>Although I have only focussed on one component of hologram imagery in a meeting framework, there are so many other vital uses like, medical, security, gaming and education. What makes this project interesting is that there is already a need for this technology, especially due to the pandemic, as it has shown the world that times are changing, business is changing. This technology will help us feel connected even though we disconnected by location. It might also be a planet saver as less travel meets less omissions and more time to remain balance with your lifestyle.</p> 
<p>The product and service offering will be scalable allowing the end using not to have to be location specific. As most people in the world already own and use their mobile phones, it would make sense to be able to use the phone as the device to be able to project the images. This will not be limited to phone users only but should be able to be launched on any device of your choosing, making this completely flexible to the end user. The images will show depth and will be continually changeable depending on the viewing angle. Some of the feature will be a real time imaging system allowing the users to interact real time with its other and make changes to topics of discussion like project using voice commands and prompts.</p>
<p>Hologram imagery is a form of photography whereby 3D objects are recording using lasers and then restored to match the original image as precisely as possible. Coherent diode lasers are required to reproduce these images. More recent technology uses a holographic projector that uses a plasma laser to float a 3D image in mid-air, using a 1kW infrared pulse laser. Currently the software used in the recreation of these images is Adobe Illustrator and MacroMedia.</p>
<p>The skills required to complete this project are highly advanced. As there has been specific software written for a number of devices that are already in circulation. The software that I am referring to is HYPERVSN CMSe which was specifically written for Hypervsn which is a 3D holographic display system which combines technology, physics and engineering to create 3D content that appears to be floating in mid-air.</p>
<p>If the project was successful it will change the way we as a society interactive with one another as this technology will not only be used in business but also in our everyday lives. For those that have relatives living in other countries it will have a profound affect by allowing them to feel more connected and included in their family’s everyday lives. Imagine we able to sit in the same room and feeling like you actually there. It will change the way we educate our children, make more accurate medical decisions and change the way we communicate with each other.</p>
